  "The vocabulary introduces the notion of a ChangeSet which encapsulates the delta between two versions of a resource description. In this context a resource description is the set of triples that in some way comprise a description of a resource. The delta is represented by two sets of triples: additions and removals. A ChangeSet can be used to modify a resource description by first removing all triples from the description that are in the removals set and adding the triples in the additions set."
